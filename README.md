===========

This repository contains various bits and pieces of code for Raspberry Pi projects.

In particular, there are libraries that drive a home brewed shield,
the _humble pi_, that supports an LCD screen, I2C sensors and an LedBorg.

Applications include:

* Train monitor. Displaying information about train departures.
* Data logging. Display and log information about environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, light levels).
* Simple twitter ticker
